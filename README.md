# Teleprompter
 A simple web based Teleprompter

Insert txt or odt files which should appear on th screen. 
Note: When inserting multiple Files, they get sorted depending of their names.

Then decide for a Text size with the buttons: bigger, smaller, standard

Now you can scroll the text when holding any key.
The scroll speed can be changed via the speed silder.
Note: When holding a key that normally scrolls the page (like spacebar or arrow_down), the scroll is independent from the speed slider
